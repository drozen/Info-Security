# Information Security Projects

Project 1 - Wrote a C program that contains the stack buffer overflow vulnerability and then wrote an exploit (e.g., Python script) to open a shell on Linux.

Project 2 - Ran malware analysis through an analysis engine (Cuckoo) and performed investigations on a malware's behaviors. 

Project 3 â€“ Implemented CBC mode encryption and decryption using DES block cipher in Java.  Collectively cracked a DES key.  Estimated how much time it takes for a single user to brute-force keys.  

Project 4:

Target 1 (t1.html) : Performed an XSRF attack on a banking website in order to transfer funds to my account.  

Target 2 (t2.html): Performed XSS-password theft.

Target 3 (t3.html): Performed an SQL injection attack in order to login to a website with only a username and without needing the password.
